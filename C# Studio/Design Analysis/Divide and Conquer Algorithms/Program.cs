/*
    Mergesort VS Quicksort performance in relation to big o.

 * Research memory requirements, 
 * time complexitry,
 * algorithm complexity (difficulty). 
 * Create a fixture to use both algorithms on the same data set multiple times. 
 * Time how long it takes for each algorithm to complete the sorting task on average.
 * Please use an input set large enough to provide data suggesting a clear winner. 
 * Make a video where you explain the two algorithms, share your research, and present your data.
